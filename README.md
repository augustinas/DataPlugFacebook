# Social Data Plug for HAT

Social Data Plug service allows HAT users to copy their personal data from Facebook to the HAT. Once the service is set up by the user it will monitor the associated Facebook account for updates and periodically synchronise the data.

## Default settings

Currently the data plug supports synchronisation of the following data type with given default intervals:

- Timeline posts (synced every 2 hours)
- Facebook events (synced every 24 hours)
- Music listens (every 24 hours)
- Facebook profile (once in a week)
- Facebook profile picture (synced on demand)

Support for other data types and features will be added in the near future.

## Main features

- Minimalistic user interface with step-by-step setup process
- Integration with MarketSquare's and Facebook's authorisation processes
- Data synchronisation scheduler
- Build using Node (v4 LTS), MongoDB and Express framework

## Getting started

### Setting up environment variables

Data plug uses environment variables to configure security-sensitive parameters. Please have the following variables set up before starting the node process.

- MARKET_ID - plug's unique ID to login with MarketSquare (obtained from MS)
- MARKET\_ACCESS\_TOKEN - access token associated with the given MARKET_ID
- MARKET_DOMAIN - domain name used by the MarketSquare (currently marketsquare.hubofallthings.net)
- HAT_USER - username to login with HATs (configured *via* MarketSquare)
- HAT_PASSWORD - password associated with the current HAT username (configured *via* MarketSquare)
- FB\_APP\_ID - Facebook application's ID (needs to be set up separately, more information can be found [here]())
- FB\_APP\_SECRET - application secret associated with the current Facebook app
- NODE_ENV - can be set to either 'production' or 'development'
- SECURE - if set to 'true' will switch to https protocol for all communications
- HOST - webserver's domain name, defaults to 'localhost' if not set
- PORT - webserver's port, defaults to 3000 if not set
- MONGODB_HOST - Mongo database's domain name, defaults to 'localhost' if not set
- MONGODB_PORT - Monog database's port, defaulst to 27017 if not set

### Configuration files

Amendments to the default synchronisation scheduler, data types and data fields being synchronised can be made in the app/config.js file and app/config/ folder.

### Starting the server

Clone the repository, install required npm modules and start the node server from project root directory. Make sure that MongoDB instance is running and environment variables are set up correctly.

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Hub-of-all-Things/DataPlugFacebook
  cd DataPlugFacebook/
  npm install
  node bin/www
  ```

Now the homepage can be accessed at http://localhost:3000 (assuming the default setup).
